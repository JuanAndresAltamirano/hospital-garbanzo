# Migration Plan: PHP to NestJS

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to migrate the hospital management system backend from PHP to NestJS. The migration will be done in stages to ensure a smooth transition while maintaining system functionality.

## Current System Analysis
- Frontend: React with Vite
- Backend: PHP REST API
- Database: MySQL
- Features:
  - Authentication system
  - Promotions management
  - File uploads
  - User management
  - Role-based access control

## Migration Stages

### Stage 1: Initial Setup and Basic Infrastructure
- [x] Create NestJS project structure
- [ ] Set up TypeScript configuration
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Set up database connection (TypeORM)
- [ ] Implement basic error handling
- [ ] Set up logging system
- [ ] Configure CORS and security middleware

### Stage 2: Authentication System
- [ ] Create User entity
- [ ] Implement JWT authentication
- [ ] Create Auth module with login/register endpoints
- [ ] Implement role-based guards
- [ ] Set up password hashing and validation
- [ ] Create user management endpoints

### Stage 3: Core Features Migration
- [ ] Promotions module
  - [ ] Create Promotion entity
  - [ ] Implement CRUD operations
  - [ ] Set up file upload handling
  - [ ] Add validation and error handling
- [ ] Additional modules (to be identified)

### Stage 4: Frontend Integration
- [ ] Update API endpoints in frontend
- [ ] Implement new authentication flow
- [ ] Update file upload handling
- [ ] Test all frontend-backend interactions

### Stage 5: Testing and Quality Assurance
- [ ] Write unit tests for all modules
- [ ] Implement integration tests
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Security audit

### Stage 6: Deployment and Monitoring
- [ ] Set up production environment
- [ ] Configure monitoring and logging
- [ ] Implement backup strategy
- [ ] Create deployment documentation

## Current Status
Starting Stage 1: Initial Setup and Basic Infrastructure

## Next Steps
1. Create new NestJS project
2. Set up basic project structure
3. Configure TypeORM with MySQL
4. Implement basic health check endpoint

## Notes
- Keep PHP backend running until all features are migrated
- Test each feature thoroughly before moving to production
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Document all API changes for frontend team
